**Some commentaries about application:**  

1) The architecture of application is MVVM and is realized with a help of Android Architecture components (ORM Room, ViewModel, LiveData);
2) I've added a little bit of RxJava into project to make the operations of insert and delele of the products asynchronous;
3) The application is made of three screens: the first contains list of all goods, the second provides form for creating of new products and the third is a separate screen with product's details
